Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on building smart machines. 
Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 
Deep learning is a technique used in machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. 
AI is widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
Natural language processing enables machines to understand and generate human language. 
Supervised learning uses labeled data while unsupervised learning works with unstructured data. 
Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and penalties. 
AI applications include speech recognition, image classification, and recommendation systems. 
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. 
Model accuracy and precision are key performance metrics in AI systems. 
The future of AI relies on ethical use and responsible development of intelligent systems. 
Transfer learning allows models to reuse knowledge from one task to improve performance on another. 
Explainable AI helps humans understand how a model makes decisions.
